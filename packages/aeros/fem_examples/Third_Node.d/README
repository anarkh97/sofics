This directory contains an example Aero-S input file that uses the "third"
node technique to compute the beam element frames necessary to compute
the beam stiffness matrix.

The third node technique goes as follows. Nodes 1 and 2 are given with
the beam element definition. A third node is necessary to define a plane
in which the element normal lives. This third node cannot be colinear
with Nodes 1 and 2. The third node does not have to be attached to another
element in the mesh. 

When the third node is added to the beam element definition, the element
frames do not have to be entered in the Aero-S input file.
