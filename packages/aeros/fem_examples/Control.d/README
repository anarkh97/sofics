This directory contains an example Aero-S input file that employs a control
law to "sense" nodal state information at each transient time step to
compute some "control" forces. 

The file control.C contains the routines that the user has to write and
compile to use with the Aero-S input file (beam10.input).

To compile control.C, edit AEROSDIR in the Makefile and then just type "make"

Then type: aeros beam10.input
