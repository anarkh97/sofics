This directory contains two example Aero-S input files that demonstrates
the use of the RESTART keyword.

Step 1:
$ aeros top.input
This will generate an output file "top.dis" containing the displacement and
rotation at the center of mass from t=0 to t=10 s, and a restart file "top.rst".

Step 2:
$ aeros top.input.2
This will generate a new output file "top.dis.2" containing the displacement
and rotation at the center of mass from t=10 to t=20 s, and a new restart
file "top.rst.2".

The output for the full time interval (i.e. t=0 to t=20 s) can be visualized
in gnuplot using, for example:
gnuplot> plot "top.dis" using 1:2 with lines, "top.dis.2" using 1:2 with lines
