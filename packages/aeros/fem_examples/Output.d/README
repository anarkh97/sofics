This directory contains an example Aero-S input file (shell800.input) that
shows the user how to select various outputs from the finite element simulation.
The user can select from displacements, stresses, strains, forces and energies
while controlling the output format, output increment for transient runs, and
whether stress is computed at the upper, median, or lower surfaces.
