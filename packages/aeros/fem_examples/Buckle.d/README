This directory contains an example Aero-S input file that performs
a buckling analysis on a simply supported beam. The initial
displacement of the structure must be input so that the geometric
stiffness matrix can be computed. 

The steps for performing a buckling analysis are as follows:

1) Perform a static analysis to get the deformed configuration
   of the structure

2) Input the displacement solution into the Aero-S input file under
   the command IDISP6

3) Use the EIGEN commands to select the number of buckling modes
   to be computed and set other options
