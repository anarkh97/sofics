# Summary

`SOFICS` (**S**tructural **O**ptimization through **F**luid-structure **I**nteraction and **C**oupled **S**imulations) is a software toolkit that optimizes the design of structures exposed to extreme loads generated by detonations. It integrates the open-source fluid dynamics solver `M2C` and structural dynamics solver `Aero-S` to model the coupled interaction of fluid flow and structural response. Leveraging `Dakota`, an open-source optimization tool, and `Gmsh`, an open-source finite element mesh generator, `SOFICS` explores various design options efficiently. By reusing a fixed fluid simulation setup and finite volume mesh across different design variations, `SOFICS` reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy. `SOFICS` simplifies and streamlines the complex task of designing impact-resistant structures, making it accessible to a broad range of users.

# Statement of need

Designing structures to withstand detonation-induced loads involves several key challenges. Detonations generate high fluid density, velocity, and pressure in the surrounding fluid medium. When the structure is impacted by such fluid flows, it can undergo large, permanent deformations that affect the dynamics of the surrounding fluid flow. This could further alter the dynamics of the structure, resulting in a two-way interaction between the fluid flow and the structural response. The boundary shared by the fluid and structural domains, the fluid-structure interface, evolves in space and time. Consequently, the finite volume mesh used for fluid dynamics calculations must be able deform and move according the motion of the shared boundary.

Few open-source solutions exist that can simulate the highly non-linear behavior of detonations and perform coupled fluid-structure simulations to evaluate the response of impacted structures. One possible approach involves coupling open-source finite volume solvers like `OpenFOAM` [@weller_tensorial_1988] with finite element solvers such as `FEniCS` [@alnaes_fenics_2015] through a coupling library like `preCICE` [@chourdakis_precice_2022], which facilitates the transfer of structural velocities, fluid pressures, and shared fluid-structure interfaces between the two independent solvers. However, such a framework typically requires a moving, body-conforming fluid mesh to accurately communicate between solvers, resulting in the need for a unique fluid mesh for each design configuration. Additionally, optimization studies can introduce designs with complex features, such as sharp edges, narrow regions, and discontinuous geometry, which can lead to poor mesh quality and increased computational complexity.

We develop `SOFICS`[^1], shown in \autoref{fig:sofics}, which streamlines the optimization of structures under detonation-induced fluid flows, providing a robust and flexible toolkit for researchers and engineers in the field. It is a utility written in Bash, that loosely-couples an optimizer and a simulation based evaluator that performs coupled fluid-structure simulations and computes the required objective and constraint values. It uses an in-house open-source fluid dynamics solver, `M2C`[^2], developed in modern C++ with an Object-Oriented programming design. `M2C` solves the compressible, inviscid Navier-Stokes equations using a high-resolution finite volume method. It supports a range of equations of state including, perfect gas, stiffened gas, and the Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation, which are widely used for simulating detonations in both air and underwater environments.

The advantages of using `M2C` for design optimization are three-fold. First, `M2C` is directly coupled with our open-source, finite element-based structural dynamics solver `Aero-S`[^3] using the partitioned procedure [@farhat_robust_2010]. Both solvers are designed for parallel computations, utilizing the Message Passing Interface (MPI) [-@mpi41] for efficient distributed processing. Second, we use the embedded boundary method [@ma_computational_2022;@wang_computational_2012;@wang_computational_2015] to accommodate large deflections. The method tracks the fluid-structure interface explicitly within a fixed, non-uniform, non-body conforming finite volume mesh, eliminating the need for mesh motion and frequent re-meshing. As a result, a single, fixed fluid mesh can be computed *a priori* and used consistently across different design configurations. Finally, `M2C` computes the interfacial mass, momentum, and energy fluxes across the fluid-structure interface using the **FI**nite **V**olume method with **E**xact multi-material **R**iemann problems (FIVER), which solves a 1D fluid-structure Riemann problem locally featuring a constant interface velocity obtained from the structural solver [@ma_computational_2022;@wang_computational_2012]. The coupled fluid-structure simulation model has been validated for several multiphase flow and fluid-structure interaction problems. These include underwater explosions and implosions [@farhat_dynamic_2013;@ma_computational_2022], cavitation [@cao_shock_2021;@zhao_long_2023], hypervelocity impacts [@islam_fluid_2023;@islam_plasma_2023], and shockwave and laser lithotripsy [@cao_shock_2019;@wang_multiphase_2017;@zhao_simulating_2023].

`SOFICS` utilizes the open-source software `Dakota` [@adams_dakota_2022] for the simulation-based design optimization studies. `Dakota` was chosen because it provides a range of gradient-based and gradient-free optimization methods, along with robust asynchronous and parallel evaluation capabilities. It treats the fluid-structure simulation as a "black-box," using a user-defined `analysis_driver` -- which can be an executable or a script -- to generate a short results file containing the necessary objective and constraint values. It employs the operating system's fork interface to spawn child processes, on which the coupled fluid-structure simulations are performed. 

To simplify usage, the `analysis_driver` is divided into three Bash scripts: `pre_processor.sh`, `driver.sh`, and `post_processor.sh`. The user can modify the pre- and post-processing scripts to fit their specific requirements. The pre-processing script reads the design parameter file from `Dakota` and generates the finite element mesh for the current structural design configuration using the open-source meshing tool, `Gmsh` [@geuzaine_gmsh_2009]. The driver script handles the execution of simulations across distributed processors.  To prevent resource conflicts between concurrent design simulations, it dynamically identifies and allocates "idle" resources based on the evaluation ID assigned by `Dakota` and the computational requirements for each design evaluation. Finally, the post-processing script then reads the results from `Aero-S`, evaluates the objective and constrain value, and writes them to the results file provided by `Dakota`. Once all design configurations have been evaluated, `Dakota` advances to the next iteration. \autoref{fig:framework} depicts the workflow for a generic optimization scheme in `Dakota`.

The process begins with the `Slurm` script on the login node, distributing asynchronous optimization jobs across available compute nodes. Each design iteration involves pre-processing (e.g., parameter setup and meshing), running the driver script, fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations, and post-processing to compute constraints and objectives. Results are iteratively fed back into the optimization model via the fork interface.](../images/OptimizationFramework.jpg){#fig:framework}
